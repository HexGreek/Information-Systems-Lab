# Simple while loop example
count = 1  # Initialize a counter variable

# Keep looping until the count reaches 5
while count <= 5:
    print(count)  # Print the current value of count
    count += 1    # Increment the count by 1 in each iteration

print("Loop completed!")  # This line will execute after the loop exits
